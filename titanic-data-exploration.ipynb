    "This is a small kernel that does data exploration of the Titanic:Machine Learning from Disaster dataset, which was obtained from Kaggle. The goal of the Kaggle challenge using this dataset is to use machine learning to predict whether a person survived or not. This is thus a binary classification task.\n",

    "The data is split into a training set (train.csv) and a test set (test.csv).\n",

    "The data set is composed of 10 variables: survival, pclass, sex, age, sibsp, parch, ticket, fare, cabin, and embarkedPort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Description of the 10 variables given are as follows:\n",
    "* survival - yes coded as \"1\", no coded as \"0\"\n",
    "* pclass - a rating is given to individuals based on their socioeconomic class: Upper (\"1\"), Middle (\"2\"), Lower (\"3\")\n",
    "* sex - male or female\n",
    "* age \n",
    "* sibsp - number of siblings and spouses\n",
    "* parch - number of parents and children\n",
    "* ticket - ticket number\n",
    "* fare - cost of ticket\n",
    "* cabin - cabin number\n",
    "* embarkedPort - symbol indicating the port at which individuals embarked\n",
