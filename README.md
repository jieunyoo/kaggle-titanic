## Analysis of Kaggle Titanic Dataset

This is a tutorial using the Kaggle Titanic dataset. It is broken up into separate parts for each stage of the data analysis process.

The test.csv and train.csv files are copies of the ones from kaggle.com

The files are available as jupyter notebooks (.ipynb extension). They will render automatically through github, but you will need a jupyter notebook reader to read them offline.
